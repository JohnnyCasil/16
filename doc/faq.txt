Frequently Asked Questions!
=======================
Do not question my motives for this project!
-----------------------

Q1. What is Project 16?

A1. a badass new 16 bit DOSGAME! When I mean 16 bit, I REALLY MEAN 16 BIT! Realmode! i8088! If this scares you, then be a buster!
Do not question my motives for making this project! I want it to be as GENUINE AS POSSIBLE! None of this fake $#@%!

Q2. Why not 32-bit?

A2. Seriously I do not want to make it if it is not authentic!
Making it 32 bit will make me quit and commit suicide and basically not want to develop it anymore .... it is in similar spirit with 8088 mph demo
Pushing the fuck out of the IBM XT and the 8088!

Project 16: a project to make an epic as fuck modern 16bit dos game that can run on old and new hardware!!!!


Ideas:
  ====  Story: 
The game takes place in year 4049

*POST MODE WWWW*

Player: What happend?
*incomming signal*
unkown: someone setup us the bomb!
Player: !!
Player: Eye get signal!!!
unknown: WHAT?
*player activates the main screen*

  ====  Player: you play as a cute synthetic robotic loli whit a massive white tshirt on who just "woke up". She has the personality of yours truly! wwww she has retro computer ports in hidden locations <incert locations here>. she is actually home made in a lab. there is ALOT of OLD as FUCK computers there wwww (like a 486 PC) which explains the serial ports, parallell ports, game ports, etc. wwww She is EXTREAMLY intelligent. wwww but needs to know more wwww and is extreamly curious about things (just like sparky4 wwwwwww)
    
  ==== Gameplay:
    She needs to get new weapons so that she can turn enemies into friends to fight the evil and get rid of EVILNESS AND GLITCHES!! The LAST LEVEL IS GLITCH Dimention AND THE MUSIC IS ALL STRANGE AND MESSED UP and the caps, num, scroll lights blink crazyly and randomly. the floppy drive will sing O_o
    this will scare the shit out of people... BUT I LOVE IT. 
    
    FLOPPIES WILL BE EVERYWHERE FSDFASFSDFSDA
    COLLECT FLOPPIES FOR POWERUPS and weapons
    the old school 5.25 inch floppy are save points?
    all sorts of floppy disks will make appearances
    including the demi disk and shit ww

    holy shit LAZOR DISKS HUUUUUUEEEGG DISKS
    
    shitty bluray disks will be used as shuriken w
    
    The game's menu is actually a DOS TUI

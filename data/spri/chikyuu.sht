# player.PCX demo sprite sheet compiler script
# (C) 2016 Jonathan Campbell

# *spritesheet declares the section used by the sprite sheet cutting tool
#
# Sprites are declared by name (which becomes the .VRL file) at the + in the form:
# +NAME@ID
#
# Sprite names are meant for temporary use when compiling the sprite sheet into VRLs.
# At some point a longer name might be provided for use in your code.
# This will fill the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY with .VRL files as directed when you
# run PCXSSCUT, make sure your makefile does this in a temporary directory when
# you integrate into your build and that your cleanup commands delete these files,
# and that your .gitignore does not attempt to commit these files.

# this format is a bit crap, but we'll improve it as needed. be patient.

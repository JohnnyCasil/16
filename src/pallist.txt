/*
 * palllist experiment
 */
/*
 * An experiment where I make 2 small linked list which points to 2 arrays
 * one is the "hardware palette" array
 * the other is "image palette" array
 * and their respectable pointers point to their [i] stuff
 *
 * the palette updater stuff i want to make is this:
 *
 * VGA		IMG
 * 1-			2-
 * 2-			4-
 * 3-			0-
 * 4-			9-
 * 5-			0-(I will figure this out later if  there is dup numbs)
 * 6-
 * 7-
 * 8-
 *
 *		MERGE THEM INTO
 *
 * VGA
 * 1-
 * 2->IMG[0]
 * 3-
 * 4->IMG[1]
 * 5
 * 6
 * 7
 * 8
 * 9->IMG[3]
 * 0->IMG[2]->IMG[4]
 *
 * i am going to work on a really big area of code it will be on the refresh system, the walking/scrolling system, things that use showpage, adding disableing 8087 functions if no 8087 detected, and a bunch of other things i cannot remember off the top of my head because i am BURNT. I need a small break~ -- -- -- -- update! i am working on this i made ZC_WALK and i am going to move to VRL/VRS soon! .

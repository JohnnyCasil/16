 * This code is licensed under the LGPL.
 * <insert LGPL legal text here>
 *
 * Compiles for intended target environments:
 *   - MS-DOS
 *   - Windows 3.0/3.1/95/98/ME
 *   - Windows NT 3.1/3.51/4.0/2000/XP/Vista/7
 *   - OS/2 16-bit
 *   - OS/2 32-bit
 *
 * A common library to autodetect the CPU at runtime. If the program calling us
 * is interested, we can also provide Pentium CPUID and extended CPUID information.
 * Also includes code to autodetect at runtime 1) if SSE is present and 2) if SSE
 * is enabled by the OS and 3) if we can enable SSE. */

/* FIXME: The 16-bit real mode DOS builds of this program are unable to detect CPUID under OS/2 2.x and OS/2 Warp 3. Why? */

/* Win16: We're probably on a 386, but we could be on a 286 if Windows 3.1 is in standard mode.
 *        If the user manages to run us under Windows 3.0, we could also run in 8086 real mode.
 *        We still do the tests so the Windows API cannot deceive us, but we still need GetWinFlags
 *        to tell between 8086 real mode + virtual8086 mode and protected mode. */

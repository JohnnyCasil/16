faad2 library.
Ported to MS-DOS/OpenWatcom by Jonathan Campbell.


Notes:

- The source code here is basically a copy of libfaad downloaded from
  sourceforge. It has been modified to compile with Open Watcom instead
  of GNU GCC & Make. Filenames are slowly being changed to fit within
  the 8.3 DOS filename limit. Until that process is complete, you will
  need a LFN-enabled DOS environment (such as Windows) or a Linux host,
  to compile this code.

- This compiles to 32-bit code only. The library doesn't act right when
  compiled as 16-bit. Decoding sorta works but the audio flutters, and
  memory corruption happens. Someday I or someone else will take this
  code and produce a modified version optimized for 16-bit real-mode
  DOS.

- This program has Covox/Disney on LPT support. It works with DOSBox's
  emulation as far as I know, but I do not have the actual hardware to
  test against.

- This program supports Sound Blaster, Gravis Ultrasound, LPT DAC, and
  PC speaker for sound output. Do not use Sound Blaster playback with
  Gravis Ultrasound SBOS/MEGA-EM, it will not work. PC speaker playback
  may sound glitchy or scratchy depending on background interrupt
  activity on your system. When using PC speaker output, make sure your
  DOS extender can handle the timer interrupt being fired at a high
  tick rate. If it cannot, your system will hang.

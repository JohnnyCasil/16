Program notes:

Award BIOS on Pentium PIIX3 motherboard:
  - The BIOS is stupid with interrupts when any one IRQ is hooked without
    calling back to the BIOS. When DOS extenders are involved (32-bit)
    hooking IRQ 0 in this manner somehow prevents the BIOS from servicing
    the keyboard (IRQ 1) even though the program has left it untouched.

    If you run the 32-bit version of this program and your keyboard does
    not respond, that's why.

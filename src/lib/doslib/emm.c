/* api library for DOS programs that want to use Expanded Memory (usually, EMM386.EXE)
 *
 * NOTES:
 *    This code is intended for use with 16-bit real-mode programs. 32-bit programs have whatever the DOS extender
 *    offers and have no need for expanded memory, in fact, the DOS extender will often take up all extended
 *    & expanded memory for it's use and leave us nothing, which is why 32-bit builds of this library do not
 *    function.
 *
 * Testing:
 *
 *    YES* = Yes, if DOS underneath provides it (or if DOS, when configured to load EMM386.EXE). Otherwise, No
 *
 * System/configuration                 Works?   Limit?
 * DOSBox 0.74                          YES      NO
 * DOSBox 0.74 +
 *   Microsoft Windows 3.0
 *     Real mode                        YES*     NO
 *     Standard mode                    NO       --                      EMM functions present, but will always report 0KB free. If more than 16MB of RAM is present, Windows causes a serious fault and DOSBox aborts
 *     386 Enhanced mode                YES*     ?
 *   Microsoft Windows 3.1
 *     Standard mode                    NO       --                      EMM functions present, but will always report 0KB free

 *                                                                       API could handle more, but remember limits are imposed by the
 *                                                                       DOS Box VM and those are apparently represented by unsigned
 *                                                                       16-bit integers, thus the 64MB (65534KB) limit.
 *     MS-DOS mode (bootdisk)           ?        ?                       I am unable to get Windows ME to make a bootdisk at this time.
 *                                                                       So I attemped to use a Windows ME bootdisk from bootdisk.com,
 *                                                                       and added DEVICE=EMM386.EXE only to find that at boot time
 *                                                                       it locks up the computer! So, I have no way of knowing what
 *                                                                       a pure MS-DOS mode EMM386.EXE from Windows ME does. It probably
 *                                                                       acts just like the Windows 95/98 versions...
 *   Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional
 *     Normal mode                      YES      32MB                    For whatever reason NTVDM defaults to NOT providing EMM memory.
 *                                                                       Limits to 32MB even if you type in larger values in the PIF editor.
 *
 * [1] EMM386.EXE for these systems will not be able to automatically find a page frame in QEMU or VirtualBox, probably because for
 *     unmapped regions the emulator returns 0x00 not 0xFF. To work around that, open CONFIG.SYS in a text editor and edit the
 *     line referring to EMM386.EXE. Add I=E000-EFFF and save. It should look like:
 *
 *     DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE I=E000-EFFF.
 *
 * [2] You're probably wondering... if Windows ME ignores AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS then how the hell do you get EMM386.EXE
 *     loaded? Well, it's very obscure and undocumented, but you can get it loaded on boot up as follows:
 *
 *        1. Go to the start menu, select "run" and type "notepad c:\windows\system.ini"
 *        2. Locate the [386Enh] section, go to the bottom of the section, and add the following lines of text to the end of [386Enh]
 *
 *             EMMInclude=E000-EFFF
 *             ReservePageFrame=yes
 *
 *        3. Reboot, and enjoy

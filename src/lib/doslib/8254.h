/* WARNING: When calling these functions it is recommended that you disable interrupts
 *          during the programming procedure. In MS-DOS mode there is nothing to stop
 *          the BIOS from trying to use the 8254 chip at the same time you are. It is
 *          entirely possible that it might read values back during an interrupt. If
 *          you do not watch for that, you will get erroneous results from these
 *          routines. Use hw/cpu.h _cli() and _sti() functions.
 *
 *          In contrast, it is extremely rare for interrupt handlers to mess with the
 *          PC speaker gate port (and even if they do, the worst that can happen is
 *          our code overrides what the IRQ is trying to do) */

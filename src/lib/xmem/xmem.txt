Can some kind soul please pass this on to x2ftp.oulu.fi for me.
I can't ftp from my currrent connection.

 
This file contains 3 files:
xmem.h   : c include file
xmem.asm : low level basic XMS acess
xmemc.c  : super easy C access via functions like fopen, fread, fwrite
           xopen, xread, xwrite, xseek etc...
 
 
FOR DOS REAL mode programs, requires HIMEM.SYS to be loaded in
config.sys.
 
... 

This should be enough code to do what ever you want with XMS.
I like to use the file style access to remind myself it isn't
as fast as say memcpy().

Cheers.
